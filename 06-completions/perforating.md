# Perforating

## Overview

Perforating creates flow paths through casing and cement into the formation. Perforation design and execution significantly impact well productivity and should be carefully planned.

## Perforation Design Parameters

### Shot Density

| Shots Per Foot (SPF) | Application |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 2-4 SPF | Standard |
| 6 SPF | Improved flow |
| 12 SPF | Gravel pack, high permeability |
| 16+ SPF | Maximum inflow |

### Phasing

| Phasing | Pattern | Application |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **0°** | All same side | Oriented perforating |
| **60°** | Six shots per plane | Good distribution |
| **90°** | Four shots per plane | Fracture alignment |
| **120°** | Three shots per plane | Gravel pack |
| **180°** | Two sides opposite | Oriented fractures |

### Perforation Geometry

| Parameter | Significance |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Entrance hole diameter** | 0.25-0.50" typical, affects gravel pack |
| **Tunnel diameter** | 0.15-0.35" typical |
| **Penetration depth** | 6-48" depending on charge |
| **Tunnel length** | Should exceed damaged zone |

## Underbalanced vs Overbalanced

### Underbalanced Perforating

**Definition**: Wellbore pressure < Formation pressure at shot time

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Instant cleanup** | Formation pressure surges out debris |
| **Less damage** | Debris expelled, not pushed in |
| **Productivity** | Often higher initial rates |

**Underbalance Guidelines**:

| Formation Type | Underbalance (psi) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Low permeability (<10 md)** | 1,000-2,000 |
| **Medium permeability (10-100 md)** | 500-1,000 |
| **High permeability (>100 md)** | 200-500 |
| **Unconsolidated** | Limited (sand control) |

### Overbalanced Perforating

**Definition**: Wellbore pressure > Formation pressure

| Aspect | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Simpler operations** | No specialized equipment |
| **Higher damage** | Debris pushed into formation |
| **Requires cleanup** | Surge, flow, or acid |

### Static vs Dynamic Underbalance

| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Static underbalance** | Pre-existing pressure differential |
| **Dynamic underbalance** | Transient created by propellant |

## Oriented Perforating

### When Required

- Hydraulic fracturing (180° phasing toward fracture)
- Avoid water/gas contacts
- Gravel pack optimization
- Horizontal wells
- Near wellbore stress considerations

### Orientation Methods

| Method | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| **Gyro orientation** | ±5° |
| **MWD orientation** | ±5-10° |
| **Mechanical orientation** | ±10° |

## Perforating Operations

### Pre-Job Checklist

- [ ] Perforating depth confirmed
- [ ] Pressure differential calculated
- [ ] Wireline/TCP procedure reviewed
- [ ] CCL log run for depth correlation
- [ ] Safety meeting conducted
- [ ] BOP/wellhead ready
- [ ] Firing system tested

### Depth Correlation

**CCL (Casing Collar Locator)**:
- Detects magnetic signature of collars
- Correlate to GR log
- Position guns precisely

**Accuracy Requirements**:
- ±1 ft for wireline
- ±3-5 ft for TCP

### TCP Firing Systems

| System | Activation |
|--------|------------|
| **Bar drop** | Physical bar drops, triggers firing |
| **Pressure** | Differential pressure activates |
| **Electrical** | Wire run separately |
| **Radio frequency** | Remote trigger |
| **Timer** | Preset time delay |

## Perforation Performance

### API RP 19B Testing

**Section 1 Testing**: Standard conditions
- Concrete targets
- Ambient temperature
- Atmospheric pressure

**Section 2-4 Testing**: Simulated conditions
- Rock targets
- Downhole stress
- Elevated temperature

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Total penetration** | Depth into target (inches) |
| **Entrance hole** | Diameter at casing ID |
| **Core flow efficiency** | Flow capacity vs. open hole |
| **Crushed zone** | Damaged rock around tunnel |

---

## Perforation Skin

### Skin Components

```
Total Skin = Sd + Sc + Sp + Spart

Where:
Sd = Damage skin (drilling, completion)
Sc = Crushed zone skin (perforation damage)
Sp = Perforation geometric skin
Spart = Partial completion skin
```

### Minimizing Perforation Skin

| Strategy | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Deeper penetration** | Bypass damage zone |
| **Higher shot density** | More flow area |
| **Larger entrance holes** | Reduced convergence |
| **Underbalanced shooting** | Less crushed zone |
| **Post-perf stimulation** | Remove damage |

## Special Perforating Applications

### Extreme Overbalance Perforating (EOP)

- High overbalance (3,000-10,000 psi)
- Creates fractures from perforations
- Breaks down formation
- Must be carefully designed

### Propellant-Assisted Perforating

- Propellant creates dynamic underbalance
- Multiple fractures from perforations
- Improved cleanup
- Used with shaped charges

### Perforating for Gravel Pack

| Requirement | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| **High shot density (12+ SPF)** | Maximize gravel placement |
| **Large entrance holes** | Allow gravel entry |
| **Phasing (90° or 120°)** | Even distribution |
| **0° phase for horizontal** | Orient to bottom |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **No flow after perforating** | Damage, low perm | Stimulate, re-perf |
| **Guns didn't fire** | Firing system failure | Retrieve, inspect |
| **Partial fire** | Detonation failure | Additional run |
| **Low productivity** | Perforation damage | Acid treatment |
| **Casing damage** | Wrong gun size | Pre-job analysis |

### Post-Perforation Evaluation

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Production log** | Verify flow from perfs |
| **Casing inspection** | Check casing integrity |
| **Noise log** | Detect flow behind pipe |
| **Temperature log** | Identify fluid entry |
