## Offshore Rig Types

### Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs)

```
JACKUP RIGS
├── Water Depth: 30-500 ft
├── Legs: 3-4 independent or mat
├── Advantages
│   ├── Stable platform
│   ├── Direct wellhead access
│   └── Lower day rates
└── Limitations
    ├── Limited to shallow water
    ├── Jacking time for moves
    └── Leg punch-through risk

SEMISUBMERSIBLES
├── Water Depth: 500-12,000+ ft
├── Hull: Dual pontoons with columns
├── Advantages
│   ├── Motion characteristics
│   ├── Variable draft
│   └── Deep water capable
└── Positioning
    ├── Moored (8-12 anchors)
    └── Dynamic positioning (DP)

DRILLSHIPS
├── Water Depth: 1,000-12,000+ ft
├── Hull: Ship-shaped vessel
├── Advantages
│   ├── Mobility
│   ├── Storage capacity
│   └── Deep water capable
└── Positioning
    ├── Dynamic positioning (DP)
    └── Moored (rare, shallow)

PLATFORM RIGS
├── Location: Fixed platforms
├── Water Depth: 30-1,500 ft
├── Types
│   ├── Platform mounted
│   ├── Tender assisted
│   └── Self-contained
└── Drilling
    ├── Development wells
    └── Workover operations
```

## Water Depth Classifications

| Classification | Depth Range | Typical Rig Type |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Shallow | 0-500 ft | Jackup |
| Mid-Water | 500-3,000 ft | Semisub, TLP |
| Deepwater | 3,000-7,500 ft | Semisub, Drillship |
| Ultra-Deepwater | >7,500 ft | 6th Gen Drillship |

## Key Offshore Considerations

### Unique Offshore Challenges

```
ENVIRONMENTAL
├── Weather/sea state limits
├── Currents (surface and subsea)
├── Temperature (water and air)
└── Hurricane/cyclone exposure

LOGISTICAL
├── Crew change schedules
├── Supply vessel coordination
├── Material lead times
├── Communications limitations

TECHNICAL
├── Subsea equipment
├── Riser systems
├── Motion compensation
├── Emergency disconnect

REGULATORY
├── BSEE requirements
├── SEMS compliance
├── Incident reporting
├── APD/permit process
```

### Personnel on Board (POB) Management

| Category | Typical Count | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Rig crew | 80-140 | Drilling/marine |
| Operator | 2-4 | Company men |
| Service | 10-30 | Logging, cementing, etc. |
| Catering | 15-25 | Food service |
| Total | 100-200 | Varies by operation |

## Quick Reference - Offshore Communications

### Radio Channels

| Channel | Use |
|---------|-----|
| VHF 16 | Distress, calling |
| VHF 06 | Ship-to-ship safety |
| VHF 13 | Bridge-to-bridge |
| VHF 67-77 | Working channels |
| 500 kHz | Distress (legacy) |
| GMDSS | Emergency system |

### Emergency Contacts

| Agency | Contact |
|--------|---------|
| Coast Guard | VHF 16 / 1-800-368-5647 |
| BSEE | 1-877-440-5046 |
| NRC (spills) | 1-800-424-8802 |
