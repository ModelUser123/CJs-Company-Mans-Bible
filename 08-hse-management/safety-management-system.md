          ▼
Step 4: Determine Controls
          │
          ▼
Step 5: Document and Review

## Safety Performance Metrics

### Leading Indicators

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Safety meeting attendance** | 100% |
| **JSAs completed** | 100% for required tasks |
| **Observations** | X per person per month |
| **Near miss reports** | Increasing (good reporting) |
| **Training completion** | 100% current |
| **Audit scores** | > 90% |

### Lagging Indicators

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **TRIR** | Total Recordable Incident Rate | < 1.0 |
| **DART** | Days Away, Restricted, Transfer | < 0.5 |
| **LTI** | Lost Time Injuries | Zero |
| **Severity Rate** | Lost days per 200,000 hrs | < 5.0 |

### Calculating TRIR

```
TRIR = (Number of Recordable Incidents × 200,000) / Total Hours Worked

Example:
2 recordables, 500,000 hours worked
TRIR = (2 × 200,000) / 500,000 = 0.8
