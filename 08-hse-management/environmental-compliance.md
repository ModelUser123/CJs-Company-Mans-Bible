## Spill Prevention

### Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC)

**SPCC Plan Required When**:
- Total aboveground oil storage > 1,320 gallons
- Or underground storage > 42,000 gallons
- And reasonable expectation of discharge to waters of US

### Secondary Containment

| Storage Type | Requirement |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Bulk tanks** | 110% of largest tank capacity |
| **Drum storage** | 10% of total or largest container |
| **Tank battery** | Dike to contain largest tank |
| **Fuel tanks** | Bermed or diked area |

### Secondary Containment Inspection

| Check | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| **Visual integrity** | Daily |
| **Drain valves closed** | Daily |
| **Liner condition** | Weekly |
| **Accumulated liquid** | Remove promptly |
| **Structural integrity** | Monthly |

## Spill Response

### Spill Classification

| Size | Classification | Response |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **< 1 bbl** | Minor | Immediate cleanup |
| **1-25 bbl** | Moderate | Report, enhanced cleanup |
| **> 25 bbl** | Major | Full response, regulatory report |
| **Any to water** | Reportable | Immediate report |
