## Key Principles

### Golden Rules of Fishing

1. **Time is Money** - Every hour spent fishing has a cost
2. **Know What You're Fishing For** - Accurate fish description is critical
3. **Right Tool for the Job** - Match fishing tool to fish type

6. **Document Everything** - Detailed records for future reference

### Success Factors

| Factor | Impact on Success |
|--------|------------------|
| Accurate fish dimensions | Critical |
| Wellbore condition | High |
| Tool selection | High |
| Operator skill | High |
| Time since stuck | Moderate |
| Hole angle | Moderate |
