# Directional Drilling

This section covers all aspects of directional and horizontal drilling operations, from well trajectory planning through execution and survey management.

## Key Concepts

### Why Directional Drilling?

- **Multi-well pads**: Drill multiple wells from single location
- **Target access**: Reach targets not directly below surface location
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Drill around existing wells, faults, or structures
- **Reservoir optimization**: Maximize exposure in pay zone
- **Horizontal wells**: Access thin or fractured reservoirs

### Common Well Profiles

| Profile | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Vertical** | Straight down | Simple reservoirs, exploration |
| **Deviated** | Single build to target | Offset targets, platforms |
| **S-curve** | Build, hold, drop | Deep targets with surface constraints |
| **J-curve** | Build and hold | Horizontal wells, extended reach |
| **Horizontal** | 90° inclination in pay | Unconventional, thin zones |

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Accurate surveys** - Know where you are at all times
2. **Proper planning** - Torque, drag, and anti-collision analysis
3. **BHA selection** - Right tools for the job
4. **Real-time monitoring** - MWD/LWD data quality
5. **Hole cleaning** - Critical in high-angle sections
