# Well Control Incidents

## Scenario 1: Delayed Kick Recognition

### Background
```
Well: Exploration well, offshore GOM
Depth: 12,500 ft MD / 11,800 ft TVD
MW: 11.8 ppg
Formation: Miocene sandstone, abnormally pressured
Operation: Drilling 8½" hole
Time: Night shift, 0230 hours
```

### Situation
```
OBSERVATIONS (in sequence):
- 0215: Driller noticed drilling break (50 ft/hr to 120 ft/hr)
- 0218: Minor increase in torque noted but attributed to sand
- 0225: Pit gain of 5 bbl noticed by derrickman
- 0230: Driller continued drilling, thought gain was normal variation
- 0235: Flow check not performed; continued drilling
- 0240: Pit gain now 12 bbl, flow with pumps off observed
- 0242: Driller finally shut in well

PROBLEM:
- 27 minutes elapsed from first sign to shut-in
- Kick volume increased from <5 bbl to 20 bbl
- Delay allowed kick to expand and complicate kill
```

### Response
```
SHUT-IN:
- Annular preventer closed at 0242
- SIDPP: 650 psi (higher than it would have been with smaller kick)
- SICP: 920 psi
- Pit gain: 20 bbl

KILL OPERATION:
- Kill mud weight calculated: 12.8 ppg
- Wait & Weight method selected
- Kill time: 8 hours (would have been 4 hours with smaller kick)
- No formation damage, well killed successfully
```

### Outcome
```
- 12 hours NPT
- Additional mud cost: $35,000
- No injuries or environmental impact
- Near-miss investigation initiated
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. DRILLING BREAKS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
   - Stop drilling at any significant rate change
   - Perform flow check
   - Don't rationalize away warning signs

2. PIT GAINS ARE KICKS UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
   - Any gain during drilling is suspicious
   - Don't wait for "confirmation" - act immediately
   - Shut in first, ask questions later

3. FLOW CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
   - After drilling breaks
   - After connections
   - Whenever uncertain

4. CREW ALERTNESS ON NIGHT SHIFT
   - Critical observations can be missed
   - Fatigue affects judgment
   - Communication is essential

## Scenario 2: Swabbed Kick While Tripping

### Background
```
Well: Development well, onshore Texas
Depth: 9,800 ft MD / 8,900 ft TVD
MW: 10.2 ppg (0.3 ppg overbalance to pore pressure)
Formation: Austin Chalk, depleted zone above target
Operation: Tripping out for bit change
Time: Day shift, 1400 hours
```

### Situation
```
OBSERVATIONS:
- Crew making good time tripping out
- Stand being pulled every 2 minutes (fast for conditions)
- Hole not being filled on every stand
- At 6,500 ft, began getting some drag
- At 6,200 ft, well started flowing

PROBLEM:
- Trip speed too fast for tight annular clearance
- Swab pressure exceeded 0.3 ppg overbalance
- Induced underbalanced condition
- Kick taken from depleted chalk zone
```

### Response
```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
- Stopped pulling immediately
- Driller set slips and closed annular
- Stabbed kelly (no IBOP on floor at the time)
- Recorded pressures: SIDPP 180 psi, SICP 280 psi
- Pit gain: 8 bbl

COMPLICATIONS:
- No IBOP meant had to close BOP with kelly
- Tight annulus made circulation difficult
- Low overbalance meant small error caused kick

KILL OPERATION:
- Weighted up 0.5 ppg
- Driller's method successful
- Well killed in 6 hours
```

### Outcome
```
- 18 hours total NPT (including trip back in)
- Revised trip procedures implemented
- Training on swab prevention conducted
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. TRIP SPEED MUST MATCH CONDITIONS
   - Tight clearances require slower pulling
   - Monitor for signs of swabbing
   - Use trip tank to track volumes

2. FILL THE HOLE
   - Fill on every stand in critical zones
   - Use pump strokes to track fill volume
   - Deviation from expected is a warning

3. OVERBALANCE MARGIN MATTERS
   - 0.3 ppg provides little safety margin
   - Consider increasing weight for trips
   - Depleted zones are particularly vulnerable

4. IBOP ACCESSIBILITY
   - IBOP should be on floor during trips
   - Pre-plan for stabbing in emergency
   - Train crew on emergency procedures
```

## Scenario 3: Underground Blowout

### Background
```
Well: Wildcat exploration well
Depth: 15,200 ft MD / 14,100 ft TVD
MW: 14.2 ppg
Formation: Deep gas sand (overpressured)
Previous casing: 9⅝" at 11,500 ft
Operation: Drilling 8½" hole
```

### Situation
```
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS:
Day 1:
- 0800: Drilled into overpressured zone, immediate kick
- 0803: Shut in with 25 bbl pit gain
- SIDPP: 1,800 psi (much higher than expected)
- SICP: 2,100 psi
- Calculated kill weight: 16.8 ppg (exceeded frac gradient!)

- 0900: Attempted kill circulation
- Pump pressure spiked when kill mud reached 9⅝" shoe
- Lost returns completely at 12,200 ft (fractured weak zone)
- Well now flowing into fractured zone (underground blowout)

Day 2-5:
- Continued attempts to establish circulation
- Pumped LCM, cement - all went into loss zone
- Formation pressure feeding gas into fractured zone
- Casing pressure building despite continuous pumping
```

### Response
```
CONTROL STRATEGY:
1. Determined conventional kill not possible
2. Engaged well control specialists
3. Evaluated options:
   - Bullheading (rejected - would worsen fracture)
   - Relief well (initiated as contingency)
   - Dynamic kill with barite plug

RESOLUTION:
- Pumped concentrated barite slurry to bridge at loss zone
- Followed with cement squeeze
- Multiple attempts over 8 days
- Eventually sealed loss zone
- Killed well from surface
- TD'd 500 ft below original target
```

### Outcome
```
- 28 days NPT
- Cost: $12 million (relief well mobilization, specialists, materials)
- Well salvaged and completed
- No surface release or injuries
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. PRE-DRILL PORE PRESSURE ANALYSIS CRITICAL
   - Offset well data was limited
   - Better seismic interpretation needed
   - Pore pressure prediction tools should have been used

2. NARROW MARGIN DRILLING REQUIRES SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
   - MPD would have allowed safer drilling
   - Casing point selection was aggressive
   - Intermediate string could have isolated weak zone

3. UNDERGROUND BLOWOUTS ARE COMPLEX
   - Cannot be solved by conventional kill methods
   - Require specialist intervention
   - Early recognition prevents escalation

4. CONTINGENCY PLANNING
   - Relief well planning should begin at first sign
   - Well control specialists should be contacted early
   - Don't wait for situation to become uncontrollable

Well: Production well, offshore shelf
Depth: 8,500 ft MD / 8,200 ft TVD
MW: 10.5 ppg
Formation: Producing sand interval
Operation: Drilling 8½" production hole
Time: 1430 hours
```

### Situation
```
DETECTION:
- 1428: Driller noticed 3 bbl pit gain on trip tank
- 1429: Stopped drilling, picked up off bottom
- 1430: Performed flow check - well flowing
- 1431: Shut in well

INITIAL DATA:
- SIDPP: 180 psi (stabilized quickly)
- SICP: 220 psi

```

### Response
```
EXECUTION:
- Pre-recorded kill sheet used
- SCR pressures already documented
- Wait & Weight method selected (single circulation)
- Kill mud mixing began immediately
- ICP: 180 + 600 = 780 psi
- FCP: 600 × (10.9/10.5) = 623 psi

CIRCULATION:
- Brought up to kill rate in 5 minutes
- Followed step-down schedule precisely
- Gas reached surface at expected time
- Minor choke adjustments required
- Kill mud at surface after 4 hours

VERIFICATION:
- Shut in after kill circulation
- SIDPP = 0, SICP = 0
- Flow check negative
- Well confirmed dead
```

### Outcome
```
- Total time: 6 hours
- NPT: 8 hours (including weighting up active system)
- No complications
- Resumed drilling same day
```

### Success Factors

4. TEXTBOOK EXECUTION
   - Followed procedures exactly
   - No shortcuts
   - Proper documentation throughout

5. CALM, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE
   - No panic
   - Clear communication
   - Toolpusher notified but didn't take over
     (crew was handling it correctly)
