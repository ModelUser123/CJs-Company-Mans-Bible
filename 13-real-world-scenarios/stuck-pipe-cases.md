# Stuck Pipe Case Studies

## Case 1: Differential Sticking - Classic Example

### Background
```
Well: Development well, offshore
Depth: 11,200 ft MD
MW: 12.5 ppg (1.2 ppg overbalance)
Formation: Highly permeable sand (500+ md)
Operation: Making connection after drilling
Time: 0600 hours (crew change)
```

### Situation
```
SEQUENCE:
- 0545: Completed drilling stand, prepare for connection
- 0550: Pumps off, pipe stationary for crew change briefing
- 0605: Attempted to pick up for connection
- Pipe would not move - stuck

OBSERVATIONS:
- No prior indication of problems
- Drilling parameters normal
- Good returns, no cavings
- Pipe static for 15 minutes across sand

DIAGNOSIS:
- Position across known permeable sand
- High overbalance (1.2 ppg = 624 psi differential)
- Pipe stationary during connection
- Classic differential sticking scenario
```

### Response
```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 30 minutes):
- Applied 50,000 lb overpull - no movement
- Attempted rotation - stuck tight
- Applied 100,000 lb overpull - slight stretch only
- Jarring attempted (down jars) - no effect

SPOTTING FLUID:
- Free point calculation: ~11,100 ft (near bottom)
- Mixed 50 bbl diesel/surfactant pill
- Spotted across stuck zone
- Applied 50,000 lb overpull while soaking

FIRST SOAK (4 hours):
- Worked pipe periodically
- No movement

SECOND SOAK (4 hours):
- Applied jarring while soaking
- After 6 hours, felt slight movement
- Continued working
- Pipe came free at hour 8

TOTAL STUCK TIME: 10 hours
```

### Outcome
```
- 16 hours total NPT (including conditioning hole)
- Spotting fluid cost: $15,000
- No fishing required
- Resumed drilling successfully
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. MINIMIZE STATIC TIME ACROSS PERMEABLE ZONES
   - Keep pipe moving during connections
   - Reduce connection time
   - Consider circulating during handover

2. OVERBALANCE CREATES RISK
   - 1.2 ppg overbalance was high for this sand
   - Consider reducing MW where safe
   - Higher overbalance = higher sticking force

3. ACT QUICKLY
   - First 30 minutes are critical
   - Apply maximum safe overpull immediately
   - Don't wait to see if it gets worse

4. SPOTTING FLUID WORKS
   - Takes time but effective
   - Patience required
   - Keep working pipe during soak

## Case 2: Key Seat Sticking

### Background
```
Well: Directional S-turn well
Depth: 9,400 ft MD (7,800 ft TVD)
Dogleg at 4,500 ft: 5.2°/100 ft
Operation: Tripping out of hole
Tool joint size: 6⅝" OD in 8½" hole
```

### Situation
```
SEQUENCE:
- Tripping out normally to 6,200 ft
- Drag increasing as approached dogleg
- At 4,600 ft, pipe would not move up
- Could lower back down without issue
- Classic key seat behavior

DIAGNOSIS:
- Severe dogleg at 4,500 ft
- Tool joint catching in groove cut by pipe rotation
- Pipe goes down, hangs up coming out
- Circulation normal (not a pack-off)
```

### Response
```
ATTEMPTS:
1. Pulled 80,000 lb overpull - no movement
2. Applied torque and pulled - slight movement, stuck again
3. Jarred up - made 50 ft, stuck again at next tool joint
4. Repeated jar/pull - progressing slowly

DECISION:
- Progress too slow (2 hours to move 200 ft)
- Risk of parting string
- Elected to RIH and ream through dogleg

REAMING:
- RIH to bottom, circulated
- Reamed through dogleg interval
- Made multiple passes
- Opened key seat sufficiently
- Tripped out successfully
```

### Outcome
```
- 18 hours NPT
- No fish in hole
- Key seat wiper run on subsequent trips
- Monitored drag trend carefully thereafter
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. DOGLEG SEVERITY MATTERS
   - 5.2°/100 ft exceeded 3° recommendation
   - Heavy drill collars through dogleg worsen wear
   - Plan wellpath to avoid severe doglegs

2. RECOGNIZE KEY SEAT SYMPTOMS
   - One-way movement (down OK, up stuck)
   - Normal circulation
   - Stuck at tool joints
   - Gets worse as you pull

3. REAMING THROUGH IS OFTEN REQUIRED
   - Jarring alone may not solve
   - Must physically remove the seat
   - Multiple passes may be needed

4. PREVENTION
   - Run key seat wipers in hole
   - Ream doglegs before trips
   - Monitor drag trends

## Case 3: Pack-Off in Reactive Shale

### Background
```
Well: Horizontal well, unconventional play
Depth: 14,500 ft MD (11,200 ft TVD)
Curve section: 9,000-11,000 ft MD
Formation: Pierre Shale (highly reactive)
MW: 10.8 ppg water-based mud
```

### Situation
```
SEQUENCE:
- Drilling lateral at 60-80 ft/hr
- Good returns, normal operations
- Noticed increasing torque trend over 4 hours
- Drag increasing on connections
- At 14,500 ft, torque spiked, stuck

OBSERVATIONS:
- Cavings in returns (small, angular)
- Pump pressure increasing
- Could not circulate (complete pack-off)
- No rotation possible

DIAGNOSIS:
- Reactive shale swelling in curve
- Cavings accumulating around BHA
- Complete pack-off of annulus
- Pressure communication lost
```

### Response
```
IMMEDIATE (Failed attempts):
- Applied 80,000 lb overpull - no movement
- Jarred up and down - no effect
- Attempted circulation at high pressure - blocked

STRATEGY CHANGE:
- Decision to soak with inhibitive fluid
- Spotted high-potassium inhibitive pill
- Mixed 100 bbl of inhibited polymer mud
- Attempted to pump into formation

COMPLICATIONS:
- Could not establish circulation
- Pill not reaching stuck zone
- Pack-off too complete

BACK-OFF:
- After 48 hours, elected to back off
- Free point at 8,800 ft (above stuck zone)
- Backed off at 8,700 ft
- Retrieved 8,700 ft of string

FISHING:
- Multiple fishing runs
- Recovered collars and motor
- Bit and stabilizers left in hole

SIDETRACK:
- Kicked off at 8,500 ft
- Sidetracked with OBM system
- Successfully drilled new lateral
```

### Outcome
```
- 12 days NPT
- Fish left in hole (1,100 ft of BHA)
- Sidetrack cost: $1.8 million
- OBM conversion cost: $400,000
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. MUD SYSTEM SELECTION CRITICAL
   - WBM inadequate for this shale
   - OBM should have been used from start
   - Inhibition requirements underestimated

2. MONITOR TRENDS
   - Torque/drag increasing over hours
   - Cavings in returns
   - Warning signs were present
   - Should have circulated clean before stuck

3. ACT ON EARLY WARNINGS
   - Increasing torque = deteriorating hole
   - Stop drilling, circulate clean
   - Consider changing mud properties
   - Don't drill deeper into problem

4. PACK-OFFS ARE DIFFICULT
   - Once complete, very hard to free
   - Spotting fluid may not reach zone
   - Back-off may be only option
   - Prevention is far better than cure

## Case 4: Junk in Hole Sticking

### Background
```
Well: Workover operation
Depth: 6,800 ft MD
Operation: Running tubing for ESP installation
Previous issue: Broken rod string in hole (parted 2 days prior)
```

### Situation
```
SEQUENCE:
- Running 3½" tubing with ESP below
- Noticed increasing weight at 5,200 ft
- Pushed through (added 10k lb)
- At 5,400 ft, tubing would not move
- Could not rotate, could not pull

OBSERVATIONS:
- No circulation (ESP below, no bypass)
- Stuck in area of prior fish
- Likely interference with rod parts

DIAGNOSIS:
- Sucker rods broke into multiple pieces
- Pieces not fully recovered in fishing ops
- Tubing got wrapped in remaining rod sections
```

### Response
```
SITUATION ASSESSMENT:
- ESP below stuck point (expensive equipment)
- No circulation possible
- Jarring would damage ESP
- Fishing potentially complex

DECISION:
- Consult with fishing company
- Run wireline to assess
- Camera run to visualize

CAMERA FINDINGS:
- Rod pieces wrapped around tubing
- Additional junk visible on bottom
- More debris than expected

SOLUTION:
- Applied careful overpull (30k lb max to protect ESP)
- Worked up and down
- Gradually unwrapped rod pieces
- Came free after 6 hours of work

SUBSEQUENT:
- POOH with ESP
- Ran junk basket/magnet
- Recovered additional debris
- Re-ran ESP successfully
```

### Outcome
```
- 24 hours NPT
- ESP undamaged
- Additional fishing cost: $50,000
- Well completed successfully
```

### Lessons Learned
```
1. VERIFY HOLE IS CLEAN BEFORE RUNNING EQUIPMENT
   - Fish recovery should be confirmed
   - Consider cleanout run after fishing
   - Junk basket run before critical equipment

2. DOCUMENT WHAT'S LEFT IN HOLE
   - Know exact inventory of junk
   - Plot depths carefully
   - Communicate to all crews

3. PROTECT EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT
   - Limit overpull when equipment at risk
   - Consider sacrificial sub
   - Plan for contingencies

4. WORKOVER AWARENESS
   - Previous problems affect current ops
   - Review well history thoroughly
   - Anticipate complications
