# Lessons Learned

Compiled key takeaways from incident investigations and operational experiences.

## Top 10 Lessons Every Company Man Should Know

### 1. Time Is Critical in Well Control
```
Lesson: Every minute of delay in kick detection and shut-in
       increases kick volume exponentially.

Evidence:
- 3-minute response: ~5 bbl kick
- 10-minute response: ~25 bbl kick
- 30-minute response: ~100 bbl kick

Action Items:
□ Never ignore pit gains, no matter how small
□ Flow check after every drilling break
□ Shut in first, ask questions later
□ Train crews to recognize and react immediately
```

### 2. Prevention Is 10x Cheaper Than Cure
```
Lesson: Investing in prevention pays massive dividends.

Cost Examples:
- Extra shaker screens: $500
- Pack-off fishing/sidetrack: $500,000+
- Proper mud inhibition: $50,000
- Reactive shale sidetrack: $2,000,000+

Action Items:
□ Don't cut corners on mud properties
□ Invest in proper hole cleaning
□ Maintain equipment properly
□ Use quality tools and materials
```

### 3. Warning Signs Precede Most Failures
```
Lesson: Most incidents have warning signs that are ignored or missed.

Common Ignored Warnings:
- Increasing torque/drag (stuck pipe coming)
- Minor equipment issues (failure imminent)
- Small pit gains (kick developing)
- Crew fatigue/complacency (human error coming)

Action Items:
□ Take all anomalies seriously
□ Document and communicate trends
□ Investigate small problems before they become big ones
□ Empower anyone to raise concerns
```

### 4. Communication Failures Kill
```
Lesson: Most serious incidents involve communication breakdown.

Failure Modes:
- Handover briefings incomplete
- Critical information not passed
- Assumptions not verified
- Language/cultural barriers

Action Items:
□ Standardize handover procedures
□ Use written communication for critical info
□ Verify understanding, don't assume
□ Create environment where speaking up is safe
```

### 5. Procedures Exist for Good Reasons
```
Lesson: When procedures are bypassed, incidents follow.

Examples:
- Skipped BOP test → BOP failed during kick
- Rushed connection → Swabbed kick
- Didn't fill hole → Lost well control
- Bypassed permit-to-work → Injury

Action Items:
□ Follow procedures without exception
□ If procedure seems wrong, fix it - don't bypass
□ Verify compliance, don't just trust
□ Understand why procedures exist
```

### 6. Human Factors Cause Most Incidents
```
Lesson: Equipment rarely fails without human contribution.

Contributing Factors:
- Fatigue (40% of serious incidents)
- Complacency (30% of incidents)
- Time pressure (25% of incidents)
- Inadequate training (20% of incidents)

Action Items:
□ Manage fatigue proactively
□ Rotate high-risk tasks
□ Never rush critical operations
□ Train beyond minimum requirements
```

### 7. Plan for What Can Go Wrong
```
Lesson: The wells that go smoothly had contingency plans.

Planning Elements:
- "What if" scenarios discussed
- Backup equipment available
- Alternative procedures prepared
- Expert resources identified

Action Items:
□ Hold pre-job risk meetings
□ Identify critical activities
□ Have backup plans for key operations
□ Know who to call when things go wrong
```

### 8. Equipment Maintenance Is Non-Negotiable
```
Lesson: Deferred maintenance eventually causes failures.

Critical Equipment:
- BOPs (must work when needed)
- Pumps (can't kill a kick without them)
- Power systems (everything depends on them)
- Drill string (fatigue failures are catastrophic)

Action Items:
□ Follow OEM maintenance schedules
□ Don't defer critical maintenance for production
□ Inspect and test per requirements
□ Replace worn items before they fail
```

### 9. Know Your Well Before Problems Occur
```
Lesson: Understanding the well prevents surprises.

Essential Knowledge:
- Pore pressure profile
- Fracture gradient
- Problem zones (loss, shale, etc.)
- Offset well experiences

Action Items:
□ Review offset well data thoroughly
□ Understand geological hazards
□ Know your margins (kick tolerance, MAASP)
□ Update knowledge as you drill
```

### 10. Leadership Sets the Tone
```
Lesson: Crew behavior reflects leadership expectations.

Leader Behaviors That Work:
- Demonstrating safety priority
- Encouraging questions
- Acknowledging good catches
- Taking responsibility for problems

Leader Behaviors That Fail:
- Pressure to cut corners
- Discouraging concerns
- Blaming without investigating
- Prioritizing schedule over safety

Action Items:
□ Model the behavior you expect
□ Recognize and reward safe actions
□ Respond constructively to problems
□ Create an environment of trust
```

## How to Capture Lessons Learned

### During Operations
```
1. Keep detailed notes of problems and solutions
2. Document decisions and reasoning
3. Note what worked and what didn't
4. Capture time and cost impacts
```

### After Incidents
```
1. Conduct thorough investigation
2. Identify root causes (not just symptoms)
3. Develop actionable recommendations
4. Share learnings across organization
```

### Institutionalizing Learning
```
1. Maintain lessons learned database
2. Include in training programs
3. Review in pre-job meetings
4. Update procedures based on learnings
```

## Final Thoughts

### The Pattern of Incidents
```
Most incidents follow a predictable pattern:
1. Warning signs appear
2. Warning signs are rationalized or ignored
3. Conditions deteriorate
4. Incident occurs
5. Investigation reveals warnings were present

Breaking the pattern:
- Take all warnings seriously
- Investigate before escalation
- Empower everyone to stop the job
- Learn from near-misses
```

### The Difference Between Good and Great Operations
```
Good Operations:
- Follow procedures
- Meet minimum requirements
- React to problems

Great Operations:
- Understand why procedures exist
- Exceed minimum requirements
- Anticipate and prevent problems
- Learn continuously
- Share knowledge freely
```
