## How to Use These Scenarios

1. **Read the situation** - Understand what was happening
2. **Consider your response** - What would you do?
3. **Review the actual response** - What did they do?
4. **Analyze the outcome** - What worked, what didn't?
5. **Extract lessons** - How can you apply this?

## Scenario Format

Each scenario follows this structure:

```
SCENARIO: Brief title

BACKGROUND:
- Well information
- Operational status
- Relevant conditions

SITUATION:
- What happened
- How it was detected
- Initial indications

IMMEDIATE RESPONSE:
- First actions taken
- Decision-making process

RESOLUTION:
- How the situation was resolved
- Time to resolution
- Resources required

OUTCOME:
- Final result
- Costs/impacts

LESSONS LEARNED:
- What could prevent recurrence
- What worked well
- What could improve
```

## Categories

### High-Impact Events
- Blowouts (prevented and occurred)
- Major environmental incidents
- Fatalities and serious injuries
- Significant well control events

### Operational Challenges
- Stuck pipe situations
- Lost circulation events
- Wellbore instability
- Cementing problems

### Equipment Issues
- BOP failures
- Pump failures
- Power failures
- Drill string failures

### Environmental Factors
- Hurricane evacuations
- Extreme weather operations
- H2S encounters
- Shallow hazards

## Key Statistics (Industry Average)

| Event Type | Frequency | Avg. NPT Cost |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Kicks | 1 per 100 wells | $150K-$500K |
| Stuck Pipe | 1 per 50 wells | $200K-$2M |
| Lost Circulation | 1 per 20 wells | $100K-$500K |
| Cement Remedial | 1 per 10 wells | $50K-$200K |
| Equipment Failure | 1 per 25 wells | $100K-$1M |

## Prevention Focus

Most incidents share common root causes:
1. **Complacency** - "It won't happen to me"
2. **Poor communication** - Information not shared
3. **Inadequate planning** - Failure to anticipate
4. **Training gaps** - People don't know what to do
5. **Equipment issues** - Maintenance failures
