```

## Casing and Cementing Approval

### Required Information
```
1. Casing Design
   - Size, weight, grade, connections
   - Setting depth (MD and TVD)
   - Expected loads (burst, collapse, tension)
   - Design factors used

2. Cement Program
   - Cement class and additives
   - Slurry weight
   - Yield and volume
   - Placement method
   - Estimated TOC (top of cement)
   - WOC (wait on cement) time

3. Formation Data
   - Expected formation tops
   - Pore pressure estimates
   - Fracture gradient
   - Problem zones identified
```

### Approval Process
```
Standard Wells: Pre-approved in APD
Unusual Wells: May require separate approval
Changes During Drilling: Sundry notice or oral approval
```

## Directional Drilling Approval

### Required Documentation
```
1. Directional Plan
   - Projected wellpath (MD, TVD, Inc, Az)
   - Target coordinates
   - Survey program
   - Anti-collision analysis

2. Drilling BHA
   - Motor specifications
   - MWD/LWD tools
   - Stabilization

3. Bottomhole Location
   - Target zone entry point
   - Lateral length and direction
   - Landing zone
   - Distance from boundaries
```

### Special Considerations
```
- Crossing lease/unit lines
- Horizontal well units
- Pooling requirements
- Increased density permits
```

## Well Spacing and Density

### Standard Spacing (Common Examples)
```
Texas (Rule 37):
- Oil: 467 ft from lease line, 1200 ft between wells
- Gas: Per field rules, typically 467-1320 ft

Oklahoma:
- Per spacing order
- Standard unit: 160 acres
- Horizontal units: 640+ acres

North Dakota (Bakken):
- Standard: 1280-acre units
- 2 wells per spacing unit (vertical)
- Horizontal wells per approved unit
```

### Exception Process
```
1. Application for Exception
   - Justify need for exception
   - Show no waste or harm to correlative rights
   - Demonstrate technical necessity

2. Notice to Offset Operators
   - Required notice period
   - Opportunity to protest
   - Hearing if protested

3. Hearing (if required)
   - Technical testimony
   - Economic justification
   - Examiner recommendation

4. Commission/Division Decision
   - Approval with conditions
   - Denial with explanation
   - Appeal rights
```

## Environmental Permits

### NEPA Review (Federal)
```
Categorical Exclusion (CE):
- Routine operations
- Previously disturbed sites
- No extraordinary circumstances
- Quickest approval path

Environmental Assessment (EA):
- New access roads
- Sensitive areas nearby
- Potential impacts identified
- Results in FONSI or requires EIS

Environmental Impact Statement (EIS):
- Major federal action
- Significant environmental impact
- Public comment required
- 12-24+ months
```

### State Environmental Requirements
```
Common Requirements:
- Storm water permit (NPDES/TPDES)
- Pit permit or containment plan
- Spill prevention plan (SPCC)
- Air quality registration
- Wildlife surveys
- Cultural resource survey
```

### Cultural Resources
```
Section 106 Compliance (Federal):
- Area of Potential Effect (APE)
- Survey by qualified archaeologist
- Consultation with SHPO/THPO
- Avoidance or mitigation plan

State Requirements:
- Varies by jurisdiction
- May require survey regardless
- Unanticipated discovery protocols
```

## Bond and Financial Assurance

### Federal Bonds (BLM)
```
Individual Lease: $10,000 minimum
Statewide: $25,000
Nationwide: $150,000
Additional for surface disturbance may apply
```

### State Bonds (Examples)
```
Texas:
- $25,000 (well depth <10,000 ft)
- $50,000 (well depth >10,000 ft)
- Blanket bonds available

Oklahoma:
- $25,000 per well
- $100,000 blanket (statewide)

New Mexico:
- $25,000 per well
- $50,000 blanket (1-5 wells)
- $100,000 blanket (6+ wells)

North Dakota:
- $50,000 per well
- $100,000 blanket
```

### Financial Assurance Alternatives
```
- Surety bond (most common)
- Certificate of deposit
- Letter of credit
- Property escrow
- Self-insurance (large operators)
```

## Permit Modifications

```
Required for:
- Change in casing program
- Change in total depth
- Sidetrack operations
