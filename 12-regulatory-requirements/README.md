## Compliance Best Practices

1. **Stay Current** - Regulations change frequently
2. **Document Everything** - If it's not documented, it didn't happen
3. **Report Promptly** - Never delay incident reporting
4. **Train Personnel** - Everyone should know their regulatory obligations
5. **Audit Regularly** - Self-audits find problems before inspectors do
6. **Build Relationships** - Know your regulators
7. **When in Doubt, Ask** - Seek clarification before acting
