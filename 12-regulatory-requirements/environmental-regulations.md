# Environmental Regulations

## National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

### Overview
```
Applies to: All federal actions
Requires: Environmental review before major decisions
Administered by: Lead federal agency (BLM, BSEE, USFS, etc.)

Levels of Review:
1. Categorical Exclusion (CE)
2. Environmental Assessment (EA)
3. Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
```

### Categorical Exclusion (CE)
```
Used when:
- Action is routine
- No significant impact expected
- No extraordinary circumstances

Examples:
- Routine drilling on existing pad
- Maintenance operations
- Minor facility modifications

Documentation:
- CE determination memo
- Checklist of conditions
- Brief justification
```

### Environmental Assessment (EA)
```
Used when:
- Unknown if significant impact
- More complex than CE actions
- Public interest concerns

Contents:
1. Purpose and Need
2. Proposed Action and Alternatives
3. Affected Environment
4. Environmental Consequences
5. Mitigation Measures

Result:
- Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
  → Project proceeds with conditions
- Determination of Significant Impact
  → Full EIS required
```

### Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
```
Required when:
- Significant environmental impact expected
- Required by law
- Agency discretion

Process (12-24+ months):
1. Notice of Intent (NOI)
2. Scoping meetings
3. Draft EIS preparation
4. Public comment period (45 days min)
5. Final EIS
6. Record of Decision (ROD)

Contents:
- Same as EA, but more detailed
- Cumulative impact analysis
- Response to comments
- Preferred alternative identified
```

Exemptions:
- <1,320 gallon total capacity
- No reasonable expectation of discharge
```

### SPCC Plan Contents
```
1. Facility Description
   - Site map
   - Tank locations
   - Drainage patterns

2. Oil Discharge History
   - Last 3 years
   - Cause and cleanup

3. Discharge Prevention
   - Secondary containment
   - Spill response equipment
   - Inspections

4. Discharge Response
   - Notification procedures
   - Response actions
   - Cleanup methods

5. Certification
   - PE certification required (most facilities)
   - Self-certification (limited)
```

### Secondary Containment
```
Requirements:
- Capacity: 100% of largest tank + adequate freeboard
- Impermeable material
- Drainage controls
- Regular inspections

Types:
- Dikes and berms
- Lined containment areas
- Double-walled tanks
- Portable containment
```

## Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

### Exempt Wastes (Exploration & Production)
```
E&P wastes exempt from hazardous waste regulation:
- Drilling fluids and cuttings
- Produced water
- Well treatment fluids
- Gas plant processing wastes
- Basic sediment and water (BS&W)
- Tank bottoms from crude storage

Note: Still regulated as solid waste
```

### Non-Exempt Wastes
```
These ARE subject to hazardous waste rules:
- Unused chemicals
- Waste solvents
- Used lubricating oil (special rules)
- Batteries
- Paint wastes
- Laboratory chemicals
- Contaminated cleanup materials
```

### Used Oil Management
```
Presumption: Used oil is recyclable unless contaminated

Management:
- Store in labeled containers
- Prevent releases
- Transport with registered hauler
- Burn in approved units only
- Keep records

Mixing Rule: Used oil mixed with hazardous waste
             becomes hazardous waste
```

## Clean Air Act

### New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)
```
NSPS Subpart OOOO/OOOOa:
- Storage vessels (95% VOC control)
- Pneumatic controllers (low-bleed or no-bleed)
- Compressors (leak monitoring)
- Well completions (reduced emissions)
- Equipment leaks (monitoring program)
```

### VOC Emissions Control
```
Common Control Technologies:
- Vapor recovery units (VRU)
- Combustors/flares
- Condensers
- Carbon absorption

Requirements:
- 95% control efficiency (typical)
- Monitoring and recordkeeping
- Performance testing
```

### Methane Regulations
```
Federal (EPA):

- Reduce over time (phase-out programs)

Venting:
- Generally prohibited
- Exceptions for safety
- Must report volumes
```

- Produced water recycling
- Solid waste reduction
- Energy efficiency
```

### Spill Response
