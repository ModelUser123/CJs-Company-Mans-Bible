## How to Use These Trees

1. **Identify the situation** - Match your current problem to the appropriate tree
2. **Start at the top** - Begin with the first decision node
3. **Answer honestly** - Base answers on actual observations, not assumptions
4. **Follow the path** - Each answer leads to the next step or action
5. **Document everything** - Record decisions and outcomes for future reference
