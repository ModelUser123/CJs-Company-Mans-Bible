## When Workover is Required

### Common Workover Triggers

| Category | Trigger | Typical Solution |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Production** | Declining rate | Restimulation, artificial lift |
| **Mechanical** | Tubing leak | Pull/replace tubing |
| **Mechanical** | Packer failure | Replace packer |
| **Mechanical** | SCSSSV failure | Repair/replace valve |
| **Mechanical** | ESP failure | Pull/replace pump |
| **Reservoir** | Water breakthrough | Plug zone, squeeze |
| **Reservoir** | Gas coning | Workover, plug back |
| **Reservoir** | Zone depletion | Recompletion |
| **Regulatory** | Environmental | Repair, P&A |
| **Economic** | Uneconomic | P&A |

### Workover vs. Intervention Decision

```
WORKOVER VS INTERVENTION
├── Workover (Pull Completion)
│   ├── Major mechanical failure
│   ├── Full recompletion needed
│   ├── Zone change required
│   ├── Significant string damage
│   └── Requires killing well
├── Intervention (Rigless)
│   ├── Minor repairs
│   ├── Wellbore cleanout
│   ├── Logging/surveying
│   ├── Plug/packer setting
│   └── Can often do live

## Equipment Overview

### Workover Rig Types

| Rig Type | Capacity | Application |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Pulling unit | 50-100k lb | Shallow wells, light work |
| Workover rig | 100-250k lb | Standard workovers |
| Drilling rig | 250k+ lb | Deep wells, drilling required |
| Snubbing unit | Variable | Under pressure operations |
| Coiled tubing | Variable | Rigless intervention |

### Key Equipment Requirements

## Planning Considerations

### Pre-Workover Assessment

```
ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST
├── Well History
│   ├── Original completion
│   ├── Previous workovers
│   ├── Production history
│   ├── Injection history
│   └── Known problems
├── Current Condition
│   ├── Well status (flowing, dead)
│   ├── Pressure (SITP, SICP)
│   ├── Fluid type in well
│   ├── H2S present?
│   └── Mechanical integrity
├── Regulatory
│   ├── Permits required
│   ├── Notification requirements
│   ├── Testing requirements
│   └── Reporting obligations
└── Objectives
    ├── Clear work scope
    ├── Success criteria
    ├── Time estimate
    └── Cost estimate
```

### Cost Estimation

| Cost Element | Typical Range |
|--------------|--------------|
| Workover rig | $3,000-15,000/day |
| Well control equipment | $500-2,000/day |
| Workover fluids | $2,000-10,000 |
| Cement services | $5,000-50,000 |
| Wireline services | $2,000-15,000 |
| Fishing (if needed) | $10,000-100,000 |
| Tubing/equipment | Variable |
| Supervision | $500-1,500/day |

## Quick Reference

### Workover Fluid Selection

| Well Type | Recommended Fluid |
|-----------|------------------|
| Oil well, normal pressure | 8.5-9.5 ppg brine |
| Oil well, low pressure | Diesel, lease crude |
| Gas well | Nitrogen, light brine |
| High pressure | Weighted brine |
| H2S present | Scavenger treated |
| Formation damage concern | Filtered, compatible |

### Safety Priorities

1. **Well Control** - Maintain kill weight fluid, BOPs tested
2. **H2S** - Monitors, breathing air, contingency
3. **Pressure** - Know pressures before starting work
4. **Dropped Objects** - Secure all tools and equipment
5. **Mechanical** - Inspect all equipment before use

*Workover operations require thorough planning and execution. Unexpected conditions are common - be prepared for contingencies.*
