## Using These Sheets

1. **Identify the calculation needed**
2. **Gather required inputs** (measurements, mud weights, etc.)
3. **Select appropriate formula** from relevant sheet
4. **Verify units** before calculating
5. **Check result reasonableness** against expected values
6. **Document all calculations** in drilling report
