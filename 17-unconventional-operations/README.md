### Key Unconventional Characteristics

```
RESERVOIR PROPERTIES
├── Permeability: 0.001-0.1 md (nanodarcies)
├── Porosity: 3-12%
├── Water Saturation: 20-60%
├── TOC: 2-10%
└── Natural Fractures: Variable

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
├── Horizontal wells required
├── Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing
├── High well density (4-16 wells/section)
├── Pad drilling for efficiency
└── Factory-style operations
```

## Operational Comparisons

### Conventional vs. Unconventional

| Parameter | Conventional | Unconventional |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Well type | Vertical/deviated | Horizontal |
| Lateral length | N/A | 5,000-15,000 ft |
| Stages | 1-5 | 30-100+ |
| Proppant/well | 100,000 lb | 5-20 million lb |
| Water/well | 10,000 bbl | 200,000-500,000 bbl |
| Days to drill | 15-30 | 15-25 |
| Days to complete | 5-10 | 10-30 |
| Wells per pad | 1-2 | 4-24 |

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Drill days (lateral) | 8-12 | 4-7 |
| Slide % | <20% | <10% |
| Stages per day | 4-6 | 8-12 |
| NPT | <10% | <5% |
| Refrac rate | <5% | <1% |
