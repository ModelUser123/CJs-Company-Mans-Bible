## Walking Rig Operations

### Walking System Types

| Type | Speed | Distance | Preparation |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Pad walking | 5-15 ft/hr | 15-50 ft | Minimal |
| Long distance | 30-100 ft/hr | 100-500 ft | Moderate |
| Conventional move | N/A | Any | Full rig down |

### Walking Procedure

```

├── Well secured (surface/intermediate)
├── BOP racked back
├── Lines disconnected
│   ├── Mud lines
│   ├── Power cables
│   └── Communication
├── Pits ready
└── Ground conditions verified

WALKING SEQUENCE
├── 1. Lift and walk mast (if telescoping)
├── 2. Walk substructure
│   ├── Hydraulic jacks engage
│   ├── Move forward/lateral
│   └── Set down on new position
├── 3. Level and align
├── 4. Reconnect systems
├── 5. Verify rig up
└── 6. Resume operations

POST-WALK VERIFICATION
├── Level check
├── Alignment verification
├── System function test
├── BOP installation
└── Ready for spud
```

### Walking Time Comparison

| Distance | Conventional Move | Walking |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| 30 ft | 12-24 hours | 2-4 hours |
| 50 ft | 24-48 hours | 4-8 hours |
| 100 ft | 48+ hours | 8-16 hours |
| 500 ft | 72+ hours | Walking impractical |

## Batch Drilling Operations

### Surface Hole Batch

```
EFFICIENCY GAINS
├── Spud → Surface Casing × N wells
├── Same BHA for all wells
├── Same mud system
├── Continuous operations
└── Time Savings: 20-40%

LOGISTICS
├── Casing staged for all wells
├── Cement program identical
├── Crews maintain momentum
└── Equipment stays rigged up
```

### Curve/Lateral Batch

```
EFFICIENCY GAINS
├── Similar BHA design
├── Geosteering team continuity
├── Motor/bit optimization
├── Mud system stability
└── Time Savings: 15-30%

CONSIDERATIONS
├── Anti-collision monitoring
├── Survey uncertainty
├── Formation variation
├── Wellbore stability
└── Liner running logistics
```

## Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS)

### SIMOPS Risk Matrix

| Operation 1 | Operation 2 | Risk Level | Controls |
|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Drilling | Completions | High | Offset distance, barriers |
| Completions | Flowback | Medium | Pressure management |
| Drilling | Production | Medium | Well barriers |
| Completions | Production | High | Isolation verification |

## Well Spacing and Interference

### Lateral Spacing Considerations

| Factor | Tighter Spacing | Wider Spacing |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Recovery | Higher total | Higher per well |
| Interference | More frac hits | Less interaction |
| EUR/well | Lower | Higher |
| Well count | More wells | Fewer wells |
| Development cost | Higher total | Lower total |
