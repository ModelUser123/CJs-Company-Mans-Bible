## Troubleshooting

### Common Flowback Issues

```
SLUGGING
├── Indication: Erratic pressure, liquid slugs
├── Cause: Gas lift, liquid holdup
├── Solution: Adjust choke, wait stabilization
└── Duration: Usually resolves in hours

EXCESSIVE WATER
├── Indication: Water cut >80% extended
├── Cause: Poor completion, water zone
├── Solution: Evaluate, consider intervention
└── Assessment: Compare to offset wells

LOW GAS RATE
├── Indication: Below expectations
├── Cause: Poor rock, completion issue
├── Solution: Analyze data, evaluate options
└── Next steps: May need stimulation

PROPPANT PRODUCTION
├── Indication: Sand at surface
├── Cause: High rate, poor consolidation
├── Solution: Reduce choke, cycle well
└── Prevention: Lower drawdown

PRESSURE BUILDUP
├── Indication: Pressure increasing shut-in
├── Cause: Normal (good rock)
├── Assessment: Build-up test for PI
└── Use: Reservoir characterization
```

### Decision Points

| Observation | Possible Actions |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Low recovery | Increase rate, evaluate completion |
| High sand | Reduce rate, install sand trap |
| Poor gas | Evaluate rock, consider restim |
| High water late | Check for communication |
| Equipment failure | Repair, continue, defer |
