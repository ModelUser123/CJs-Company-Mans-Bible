## Rig Types

### Land Rigs

| Class | Depth Rating | HP Range | Typical Application |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Light Duty | < 10,000 ft | 500-750 | Shallow vertical wells |
| Medium Duty | 10,000-15,000 ft | 1,000-1,500 | Intermediate depth, simple directional |
| Heavy Duty | 15,000-20,000 ft | 1,500-2,000 | Deep wells, complex directional |
| Super Heavy | > 20,000 ft | 2,000-3,000 | Ultra-deep, HPHT |
| AC Electric | Varies | Varies | Precise control, pad drilling |

### Offshore Rigs

| Type | Water Depth | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Jack-up | < 400 ft | Self-elevating, most common shallow water |
| Platform | Fixed | Permanent installation |
| Semi-submersible | 200-10,000 ft | Floating, moored or DP |
| Drillship | 200-12,000 ft | Vessel, highest mobility |

|--------|--------|------------------|
| TRIR | < 1.0 | |
| DART | < 0.5 | |
| Fatalities (3 yr) | 0 | |
| Regulatory Citations | 0 | |
| STOP Card Rate | > 1.0/man-hour | |

**Required Documentation:**
```
□ Safety manual current
□ Emergency response plan
□ HSE statistics verified
□ Training records reviewed
□ Equipment certifications current
□ Insurance coverage adequate
```

### Step 5: Commercial Evaluation

**Cost Components:**

| Item | Daily Rate | Est. Days | Total |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Rig Day Rate | | | |
| Mob/Demob | - | - | |
| Third Party Pass-through | | | |
| Fuel (if separate) | | | |
| Rig Insurance | | | |
| **Total Rig Cost** | | | |

### Step 6: Contractor Interview

**Topics to Cover:**
- Recent performance on similar wells
- Crew experience and turnover
- Maintenance philosophy
