# AFE Management

## Authorization for Expenditure (AFE)

The AFE is the foundational financial document for any drilling operation. It serves as both a budget and authorization tool.

## AFE Components

### 1. Direct Costs

| Category | Description | Typical % of Total |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Rig Costs | Day rates, mob/demob | 25-35% |
| Drilling Services | MWD, mud logging, directional | 15-20% |
| Tubulars | Casing, tubing, drill pipe rental | 10-15% |
| Mud & Chemicals | Drilling fluid, additives | 8-12% |
| Cementing | Cement, services | 5-8% |
| Bits | PDC, roller cone, mills | 3-5% |
| Rental Tools | Jars, stabilizers, reamers | 3-5% |
| Completion | Perforating, frac, flowback | 15-25% |

### 2. Indirect Costs

- Location construction
- Access roads
- Water supply
- Waste disposal
- Insurance
- Overhead allocation

### 3. Contingency

**Standard Contingency Guidelines:**
- Development wells: 10-15%
- Exploratory wells: 15-25%
- Complex/HPHT wells: 20-30%

## AFE Development Process

### Step 1: Technical Scope Definition
```
□ Well objectives defined
□ Target depth established
□ Casing program designed
□ Drilling program developed
□ Completion method selected
```

### Step 2: Cost Estimation
```
□ Historical well data reviewed
□ Current market rates obtained
□ Vendor quotes requested
□ Internal estimates developed
□ Third-party estimates obtained (if required)
```

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
```
□ Technical risks identified
□ Mitigation plans developed
□ Contingency amounts assigned
□ Insurance requirements reviewed
```

### Step 4: Approval Process
```
□ Engineering review complete
□ Operations review complete
□ Financial review complete
□ Management approval obtained
□ Partner approval (if applicable)
```

## AFE Tracking & Variance Analysis

### Daily Cost Tracking

| Item | AFE | Actual | Variance | % |
|------|-----|--------|----------|---|
| Rig | | | | |
| Services | | | | |
| Materials | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | |

### Variance Thresholds

| Variance Level | Action Required |
|----------------|-----------------|
| < 5% | Monitor, no action |
| 5-10% | Report to supervisor |
| 10-15% | Written explanation required |
| > 15% | AFE revision consideration |

---

## AFE Revision (Supplement)

### When to Supplement

- Projected overrun exceeds authorization authority
- Significant scope change
- Partner approval required
- New risks identified requiring additional budget

### Supplement Requirements

1. **Justification**: Clear explanation of variance cause
2. **Updated Estimate**: Revised cost projection to TD
3. **Approval**: Same approval chain as original AFE
4. **Documentation**: Full audit trail maintained

## Cost Categories - Detailed

### IADC Cost Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 01 | Intangible Drilling Costs |
| 02 | Tangible Completion Equipment |
| 03 | Geological & Geophysical |
| 04 | Overhead |
| 05 | Contingency |

### Common Line Items

**Drilling Phase:**
- Rig day rate
- Mobilization/demobilization
- Fuel
- Water
- Drilling mud & chemicals
- Casing & accessories
- Cement & services
- Bits & tools
- Directional services
- MWD/LWD
- Mud logging
- Wireline logging
- Fishing tools
- Rig supervision

**Completion Phase:**
- Completion rig (if different)
- Tubing & accessories
- Packers & equipment
- Perforating
- Stimulation/fracturing
- Flowback operations
- Surface facilities tie-in

## Budget Best Practices

### 1. Use Reliable Data Sources
- Offset well performance
- Current contract rates
- Recent quotes (< 90 days)
- Internal cost database

### 2. Account for Market Conditions
- Supply/demand cycles
- Commodity price impacts
- Regional activity levels
- Seasonal factors

### 3. Build Appropriate Contingency
- Base on specific well risks
- Don't use contingency as padding
- Document contingency assumptions
- Track contingency usage separately

### 4. Regular Forecasting
- Daily: Actual costs vs. AFE
- Weekly: Updated projection to TD
- As-needed: Variance explanations

## Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Target | Calculation |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Cost per Foot | Varies | Total Cost / Total Depth |
| Rig Efficiency | > 85% | Drilling Hours / Total Hours |
| NPT % | < 10% | NPT Hours / Total Hours |
| AFE Accuracy | ± 10% | (Actual - AFE) / AFE |

---

## Common AFE Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating contingency** - Particularly on exploratory wells
2. **Outdated cost data** - Market rates change quickly
3. **Scope creep** - Adding items without formal revision
4. **Poor variance tracking** - Not catching overruns early
5. **Inadequate documentation** - Audit trail issues
