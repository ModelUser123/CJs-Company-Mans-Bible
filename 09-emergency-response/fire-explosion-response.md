| **Electrical** | Proper classification, maintenance |
| **Static** | Grounding, bonding |
| **Friction** | Maintenance, lubrication |
| **Hot surfaces** | Guards, insulation |
| **Open flame** | Elimination, permits |
| **Smoking** | Designated areas only |

### Fuel Sources

## Fire Response

### RACE Response

```
R - RESCUE   ─── Remove people in immediate danger
A - ALARM    ─── Sound the alarm, call for help
C - CONTAIN  ─── Close doors, isolate area
E - EXTINGUISH ─ Fight fire if safe to do so
               OR
    EVACUATE ─── Leave if fire is too large
