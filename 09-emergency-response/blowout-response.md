# Blowout Response

## Overview

A blowout is an uncontrolled flow of formation fluids to surface. While rare due to modern well control practices, knowing how to respond to a blowout situation is critical for protecting lives and the environment.

## Blowout Recognition

### Warning Signs

| Indicator | Observation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flow with pumps off** | Mud flowing from well |
| **Pit gain** | Increasing pit volume |
| **Gas at surface** | High gas readings, bubbling |
| **Increasing flow** | Rate exceeding pump rate |
| **Pressure increase** | Unexpected pressure rise |
| **Noise** | Unusual sounds from well |

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| **Evacuate rig?** | If cannot shut in, YES |
| **Ignite deliberately?** | Only if H2S present and cannot control |
| **Attempt well control?** | Only if safe and trained |
| **Call for help?** | Always - immediately |

---

## Blowout Types

### Surface Blowout

**Flow Path**: Through BOPs to surface

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| **Through annulus** | BOP rams failed or not closed |
| **Through drill pipe** | Float failed, upper connection |
| **Broaching** | Flow around casing, up outside |

### Underground Blowout

**Flow Path**: Into another formation

| Indicator | Observation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Lost circulation** | Mud losses increase |
| **Pressure changes** | Unusual pressure behavior |
| **Surface sink** | Ground subsidence |
| **Cratering** | Severe underground flow |

---

## Safety Perimeter

### Minimum Safe Distances

| Condition | Distance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Unignited blowout** | 500+ ft |
| **Ignited blowout** | 1,000+ ft (heat dependent) |
| **H2S present** | Per wind conditions, much further |
| **Potential ignition** | No vehicles within 500 ft |

### Perimeter Controls

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Block access roads** | Prevent entry |
| **Post guards** | Control perimeter |
| **Eliminate ignition** | Remove vehicles, equipment |
| **Wind monitoring** | Adjust perimeter as needed |

| 5 | Close valves |
| 6 | Monitor pressures |
| 7 | Begin kill operations |

### Capping Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Wellhead condition** | Damaged or intact? |
| **Flow type** | Gas, oil, both |
| **Pressure** | Capping stack rating |
| **Fire** | May need to extinguish first |
| **Access** | Personnel safety |
