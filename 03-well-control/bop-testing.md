# BOP Testing

## Overview

Blowout Preventer (BOP) testing ensures equipment will function properly in a well control situation. Regular testing is required by regulation and company policy.

## BOP Components

### Stack Configuration (Typical Land)

**From top to bottom:**
1. Annular preventer
2. Pipe rams (upper)
3. Blind/shear rams
4. Pipe rams (lower)
5. Drilling spool
6. Casing head

### Component Functions

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Annular | Seal around any shape/size |
| Pipe Rams | Seal around specific pipe size |
| Blind Rams | Seal open hole (no pipe) |
| Shear Rams | Cut pipe, seal well |
| Variable Bore | Seal range of pipe sizes |
| Casing Shear | Cut casing (subsea) |

## Test Requirements

### Regulatory Requirements

**API RP 53 / 30 CFR 250 Requirements:**

| Test Type | Frequency | Pressure |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Pressure test | Per regulation | Full rated / 200-300 psi |
| Function test | Weekly | N/A |
| Accumulator test | Weekly | N/A |
| Drill (response) | Weekly | N/A |

### Pressure Test Schedule

| Event | Test Required |
|-------|---------------|
| Initial installation | Full test |
| After disconnect | Full test |
| After repair | Full test |
| Before drilling out casing | Per program |
| Maximum interval | 21 days (or per regulation) |

## Pressure Testing Procedures

### Low Pressure Test (200-300 psi)

**Purpose:** Verify seal at low pressure (detects different failures than high pressure)

**Procedure:**
1. Close component to be tested
2. Apply low pressure (200-300 psi)
3. Hold for required time (5-10 minutes)
4. Observe for pressure decline
5. Document results

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No pressure decline
- Visual inspection shows no leaks

### High Pressure Test (Full Rated)

**Purpose:** Verify component meets full working pressure rating

**Test Pressures:**
| Equipment Rating | Test Pressure |
|------------------|---------------|
| 3,000 psi | 3,000 psi |
| 5,000 psi | 5,000 psi |
| 10,000 psi | 10,000 psi |
| 15,000 psi | 15,000 psi |

**Procedure:**
1. Close component to be tested
2. Apply pressure gradually (not to exceed 10%/min)
3. Reach test pressure
4. Hold for required time (5-10 minutes minimum)
5. Observe for pressure decline
6. Record pressure vs. time
7. Document results

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Maximum allowable decline: Per company policy (typically 0 psi or ≤3% in 10 min)
- No visible leaks
- Pressure stable

## Component-Specific Testing

### Annular Preventer

**Test Configuration:**
- Close on drill pipe
- Test on pipe and casing

**Special Considerations:**
- Element condition critical
- Operating pressure vs. test pressure
- Temperature effects on element

### Pipe Rams

**Test Configuration:**
- Close on correct size pipe
- Ensure pipe centered

**Special Considerations:**
- Ram size must match pipe
- Packer element condition
- Top seal integrity

### Blind Rams / Blind Shear Rams

**Test Configuration:**
- No pipe in hole
- Or: Test with test plug

**Special Considerations:**
- Verify no pipe before closing blind rams
- Shear function test separate from seal test

### Choke and Kill Lines

**Test Configuration:**
- Include all valves and manifold
- Test choke line and kill line separately

**Special Considerations:**
- Test from BOP to manifold
- Include all valves in test
- Verify choke function

## Function Testing

### Weekly Function Test Requirements

```
□ Close and open annular preventer
□ Close and open all pipe rams
□ Close and open blind/shear rams
□ Operate choke (manual and remote)
□ Verify position indicator operation
□ Check accumulator precharge
□ Verify remote panel operation
```

### Accumulator Test

**Requirements:**
- Close annular and one set of rams
- Without recharge
- Maintain 200 psi above precharge
- Have reserve for additional closes

**Procedure:**
1. Record initial accumulator pressure
2. Isolate pumps (no recharge)
3. Close annular preventer
4. Close one set of pipe rams
5. Open annular
6. Record final pressure
7. Verify > 200 psi above precharge

### Remote Panel Test

**Test all remote stations:**
```
□ Rig floor panel
□ Driller's panel
□ Remote panel (if installed)
□ All functions operate correctly
□ Position indicators function
```

## BOP Drills

### Weekly Drill Requirements

**Purpose:** Verify crew response and timing

**Drill Types:**
- Pit gain detection
- Flow check
- Shut-in procedure
- Space-out and hang-off

**Documentation:**
- Date and time
- Crew members involved
- Response time
- Problems identified
- Corrective actions

### Drill Procedure

1. **Announce drill** (ensure not actual kick)
2. Start timer
3. Sound alarm
4. Crew responds
5. Complete shut-in (don't close BOP if drilling)
6. Stop timer
7. Record results
8. Debrief crew

**Target Response Times:**
| Operation | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Pick up off bottom | 30 seconds |
| Space out | 1 minute |
| Shut in | 2 minutes total |

## Test Documentation

### Required Records

**For each pressure test:**
- Date and time
- Components tested
- Test pressure (low and high)
- Hold time
- Pressure at end of test
- Pass/fail determination
- Personnel conducting test
- Witness signature

## Troubleshooting

### Common Test Failures

| Problem | Possible Cause | Corrective Action |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Annular leaks | Worn element | Replace element |
| Ram leaks | Damaged packer | Replace packer/seals |
| Blind ram leaks | Debris on seal | Clean, inspect |
| Choke line leak | Valve seat damage | Repair/replace valve |
| Accumulator low | Precharge loss | Recharge, check bladder |

### Failure Response

1. **Do not drill ahead with failed BOP**
2. Identify cause of failure
3. Repair or replace component
4. Retest after repair
5. Document failure and repair
6. Notify appropriate parties

---

## Equipment Inspection

### Visual Inspection (Daily)

```
□ No visible leaks
□ Connections tight
□ Ram position indicators correct
□ Accumulator pressure adequate
□ Choke/kill valves accessible
□ Control panels operational
```

### Detailed Inspection (After Each Well)

```
□ Ram element condition
□ Annular element condition
□ Seals and packing
□ Bonnet bolts and studs
□ Hinge pins and operating rods
□ Wellbore surfaces
```
