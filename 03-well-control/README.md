2. [Well Control Procedures](./well-control-procedures.md) - Standard operating procedures
3. [Kick Detection](./kick-detection.md) - Early warning signs and monitoring

## Well Control Philosophy

**Prevention > Detection > Response**

1. **Prevention**: Maintain adequate mud weight, proper procedures
2. **Detection**: Monitor for early kick indicators
3. **Response**: Follow established procedures, kill well safely

## Critical Well Control Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Primary Well Control | Using hydrostatic pressure to control formation pressure |
| Secondary Well Control | Using BOP to control influx while circulating kick out |
| MASP | Maximum Allowable Surface Pressure |
| MAASP | Maximum Allowable Annular Surface Pressure |
| Kill Weight Mud | Mud weight required to balance formation pressure |
| ICP | Initial Circulating Pressure |
| FCP | Final Circulating Pressure |

## Emergency Contacts

**In a well control event:**
1. Shut in well immediately
2. Notify Company Man
3. Contact well control specialists if needed
4. Document all actions
