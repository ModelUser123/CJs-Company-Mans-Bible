# Formation Evaluation

This section covers all methods of evaluating formations during and after drilling, from real-time mudlogging through wireline logging, coring, and formation testing.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Mudlogging](mudlogging.md) | Real-time cuttings analysis, gas detection, show evaluation |
| [Wireline Logging](wireline-logging.md) | Open hole and cased hole logging suites |
| [Coring Operations](coring-operations.md) | Conventional coring, sidewall cores, core handling |
| [Formation Testing](formation-testing.md) | DST, wireline formation testers, pressure analysis |
| [Petrophysics Basics](petrophysics-basics.md) | Log interpretation, porosity, saturation calculations |

## Key Concepts

### Why Formation Evaluation?

- **Pay zone identification** - Locate hydrocarbon-bearing intervals
- **Reservoir characterization** - Understand rock and fluid properties
- **Completion design** - Select optimal completion intervals
- **Reserve estimation** - Calculate hydrocarbons in place
- **Drilling optimization** - Identify drilling hazards

### Evaluation Methods Comparison

| Method | Timing | Data Type | Depth of Investigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Mudlogging** | Real-time | Cuttings, gas | Wellbore only |
| **MWD/LWD** | Real-time | Logs while drilling | Near wellbore |
| **Wireline** | After drilling | High-resolution logs | Variable |
| **Coring** | While drilling | Physical samples | Core volume |
| **Formation testing** | After drilling | Pressures, fluids | Reservoir scale |

### Data Integration

```
Mudlog + LWD + Wireline + Core + Test = Complete Picture
   ↓        ↓       ↓        ↓      ↓
 Shows → Quick → Detail → Ground → Flow
 First   Look    Analysis  Truth   Rates
```

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Data quality** - Garbage in, garbage out
2. **Timely decisions** - Evaluate while drilling
3. **Integration** - Combine all data sources
4. **Experience** - Interpretation requires judgment
5. **Communication** - Geologist-Company Man coordination
