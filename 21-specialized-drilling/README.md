### Technology Comparison

```
CONVENTIONAL vs SPECIALIZED
├── Conventional (Overbalanced)
│   ├── MW > pore pressure
│   ├── Primary barrier is hydrostatic
│   ├── Simple, well understood
│   ├── Works for most wells
│   └── May cause damage
├── MPD
│   ├── MW closer to pore pressure
│   ├── Surface backpressure control
│   ├── Maintains constant BHP
│   ├── Expands drilling window
│   └── Requires special equipment
├── UBD
│   ├── BHP < pore pressure
│   ├── Formation flows while drilling
│   ├── Minimizes damage
│   ├── Increases ROP
│   └── Complex well control
└── HPHT
    ├── Any of above in extreme conditions
    ├── Special equipment rated for T&P
    ├── Enhanced safety systems
    └── Specialized procedures
```

## Key Challenges

### Narrow Drilling Windows

```
DRILLING WINDOW CHALLENGES
├── Pore Pressure Close to Frac Gradient
│   ├── Limited mud weight range
│   ├── Easy to kick or fracture
│   ├── Difficult casing points
│   └── ECD critical
├── Solutions
│   ├── MPD (control ECD)
│   ├── Casing while drilling (CwD)
│   ├── Liner drilling
│   ├── Expandable liners
│   └── More casing strings
└── Planning Considerations
    ├── Accurate pore pressure prediction
    ├── LOT/FIT at every shoe
    ├── ECD modeling
    └── Contingency planning
```

### Temperature Challenges

| Temperature | Classification | Special Considerations |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| <250°F | Normal | Standard equipment |
| 250-350°F | Moderate HT | Some derating |
| 350-400°F | High temperature | Special equipment |
| >400°F | Extreme | Limited equipment options |

### Pressure Challenges

| Pressure | Classification | Equipment Requirements |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| <10,000 psi | Normal | Standard equipment |
| 10,000-15,000 psi | High pressure | Enhanced ratings |
| 15,000-20,000 psi | Very high | 15K-20K rated |
| >20,000 psi | Ultra high | Specialty equipment |
