# Stimulation & Fracturing

This section covers all aspects of well stimulation, from matrix acidizing through hydraulic fracturing, including frac operations and flowback management.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Matrix Acidizing](matrix-acidizing.md) | Acid types, sandstone vs carbonate, placement |
| [Hydraulic Fracturing](hydraulic-fracturing.md) | Frac theory, fluid systems, proppant selection |
| [Frac Operations](frac-operations.md) | Pre-frac testing, stage isolation, execution |
| [Flowback Operations](flowback-operations.md) | Equipment, procedures, fluid recovery, first production |
| [Frac Diagnostics](frac-diagnostics.md) | Pressure analysis, microseismic, production logging |

## Key Concepts

### Why Stimulation?

- **Damage bypass** - Restore productivity lost during drilling
- **Productivity enhancement** - Increase flow capacity beyond natural state
- **Reserve recovery** - Access oil/gas that wouldn't otherwise flow
- **Economics** - Turn marginal wells into profitable producers

### Stimulation Methods Comparison

| Method | Mechanism | Penetration | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Matrix acidizing** | Dissolve damage | Near-wellbore | Carbonates, damage removal |
| **Acid fracturing** | Create etched channels | Medium | Carbonates |
| **Hydraulic fracturing** | Create propped fractures | Deep | Low-perm, unconventional |

### Frac Job Scale (Unconventional)

| Parameter | Typical Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Stages per well | 20-60 | Depends on lateral length |
| Clusters per stage | 3-6 | Perforation clusters |
| Fluid per stage | 8,000-15,000 bbl | Slickwater typical |
| Proppant per stage | 200,000-500,000 lb | 100 mesh to 40/70 |
| Pump rate | 80-100 bpm | Per stage |
| Treat pressure | 8,000-12,000 psi | Surface treating pressure |

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Reservoir characterization** - Understand what you're fracturing
2. **Design optimization** - Right fluid, proppant, and volumes
3. **Execution quality** - Rate, pressure, proppant concentration
4. **Flowback management** - Protect proppant pack, recover fluids
5. **Diagnostics** - Learn and improve
