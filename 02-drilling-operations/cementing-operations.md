# Cementing Operations

## Overview

Cementing operations are critical for well integrity, zonal isolation, and casing support. Proper cement design and execution ensures long-term well performance.

## Cementing Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Zonal Isolation**: Prevent fluid migration between formations
2. **Casing Support**: Provide structural support for casing
3. **Corrosion Protection**: Protect casing from corrosive fluids
4. **Wellbore Stability**: Support wellbore and prevent collapse

### Secondary Objectives
- Seal lost circulation zones
- Plug abandoned intervals
- Support completion equipment

| Class | Depth Range | Application |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| A | 0-6,000 ft | Surface casing, no special properties |
| B | 0-6,000 ft | Moderate sulfate resistance |
| C | 0-6,000 ft | High early strength |
| G | 0-8,000 ft | General purpose, most common |
| H | 0-8,000 ft | Similar to G, coarser grind |

### Cement Density Ranges

## Cement Additives

### By Function

| Function | Additive Types | Application |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Accelerators | CaCl2, NaCl | Cold wells, fast set |
| Retarders | Lignosulfonate, CMHEC | Deep wells, high temp |
| Extenders | Bentonite, pozzolans | Increase volume, reduce cost |
| Weight materials | Barite, hematite | Increase density |
| Fluid loss | Latex, cellulose | Control filtrate loss |
| Dispersants | Polymers | Improve pumpability |
| Lost circulation | Fibers, flakes, granules | Seal losses |
| Gas migration | Latex, right-angle set | Prevent gas channeling |

### Common Additive Concentrations

## Cement Design Parameters

### Slurry Properties

| Property | Target | Test Method |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Density | Per design | Pressurized mud balance |
| Thickening Time | Placement + safety | Consistometer |
| Compressive Strength | >500 psi @ 24hr | Destructive/UCA |
| Fluid Loss | <50 ml/30min | API FL test |
| Free Water | <2% (vertical) | API free water |
| Rheology | Pumpable | Rheometer |

### Design Considerations

**Temperature:**
- BHCT (circulating): For thickening time
- BHST (static): For compressive strength
- Gradient: ~1.6°F/100 ft (varies)

**Pressure:**
- Hydrostatic during placement
- Formation pressure (after WOC)
- Affects set time and properties

### Thickening Time Requirements

```
Minimum Thickening Time = 
  Surface Mixing Time +
  Pump Time +
  Displacement Time +
  Safety Factor (30-60 min)
```

## Cement Volume Calculations

### Annular Volume

```
Annular Volume (bbl/ft) = (Dh² - Dc²) / 1029.4

Where:
Dh = Hole diameter (in)
Dc = Casing OD (in)
```

### Cement Volume with Excess

```
Cement Required = Annular Volume × (1 + Excess Factor)

Typical Excess:
- Open hole: 50-100%
- Cased hole: 0-10%
- Based on caliper: Calculated
```

### Sack Calculation

```
Cement Sacks = Volume (bbl) × 5.615 / Yield (ft³/sack)

Typical Yields:
- Neat Class G: 1.15 ft³/sack
- Extended: 1.5-2.5 ft³/sack
```

### Water Requirements

```
Water (gal) = Cement (sacks) × Water Requirement (gal/sack)

Typical Water Requirements:
- Class G: 4.97 gal/sack (44% by weight)
- Class H: 4.29 gal/sack (38% by weight)
```

## Cement Placement Methods

### Conventional (Plug and Displacement)

**Sequence:**
1. Circulate and condition hole
2. Release bottom plug
3. Pump spacer
4. Pump lead cement
5. Pump tail cement
6. Release top plug
7. Displace with mud
8. Bump plug
9. Wait on cement (WOC)

### Two-Stage Cementing

**Application:**
- Long casing strings
- Multiple zones to isolate
- Weak formations

**Sequence:**
1. First stage: Cement to stage collar
2. Open stage collar
3. Second stage: Cement upper interval
4. Close stage collar
5. WOC

### Liner Cementing

**Special Considerations:**
- Smaller annular clearance
- Limited pump rates
- Running tool operations
- Liner top squeeze potential

### Squeeze Cementing

**Applications:**
- Repair primary cement
- Seal perforations
- Block water or gas
- Isolate zones

## During Cementing

### Monitoring Requirements

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Density | ± 0.2 ppg of design |
| Rate | Per program |
| Pressure | Below frac gradient |
| Volume | Track against calculated |
| Returns | Monitor for losses |

### Critical Points

1. **Spacer Ahead**: Separate cement from mud
2. **Cement Mixing**: Maintain density
3. **Pump Rate**: Control ECD
4. **Displacement**: Track volumes
5. **Plug Bump**: Confirm landing
6. **Pressure Test**: Verify integrity

### Pump Schedule Example

| Stage | Volume (bbl) | Rate (bpm) | Density (ppg) |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Spacer | 20 | 4 | 10.0 |
| Lead | 100 | 4-6 | 13.5 |
| Tail | 50 | 4-6 | 16.5 |
| Displacement | 385 | 6-8 | 10.2 |

## Post-Cement Operations

### Wait on Cement (WOC)

**Minimum WOC Times:**
| Application | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| Surface casing | 8-12 hours |
| Intermediate | 12-24 hours |
| Production | 24-48 hours |
| Before perforation | Per compressive strength |

### Cement Evaluation

**Logging Options:**
- CBL (Cement Bond Log)
- VDL (Variable Density Log)
- Ultrasonic (Segmented Bond Tool)
- Pulse echo

**Quality Indicators:**
| Parameter | Good Bond | Poor Bond |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CBL amplitude | < 20 mV | > 40 mV |
| VDL | Strong formation | Casing arrivals |
| Transit time | Formation | Casing |

## Remedial Cementing

### Squeeze Cementing Procedure

1. **Locate problem zone**
2. **Isolate interval** (packers, bridge plugs)
3. **Perforate** (if needed)
4. **Squeeze cement**
5. **Maintain pressure**
6. **WOC**
7. **Test** (pressure, log)

### Squeeze Pressure Guidelines

```
Maximum Squeeze Pressure < Frac Gradient × TVD

Apply hesitation squeeze:
- Pump small volume
- Hold pressure
- Repeat until pressure holds
```

## Common Problems

### Lost Circulation During Cement

**Indicators:**
- No returns
- Drop in pump pressure
- Loss of volume

**Responses:**
- Reduce pump rate
- Add LCM to cement
- Use foam cement
- Stage cement job

### Channeling

**Causes:**
- Poor mud removal
- Inadequate centralization
- Poor cement properties
- Contamination

**Prevention:**
- Proper hole conditioning
- Adequate centralizers
- Spacer ahead of cement
- Pipe movement (rotation/reciprocation)

### Microannulus

**Causes:**
- Pressure/temperature changes
- Casing expansion/contraction
- Cement shrinkage

**Detection:**
- Poor CBL without obvious cause
- Pressure at casing shoe

**Remediation:**
- Squeeze cement
- Expand casing (thermal)

---

## Safety Considerations

### Cementing Safety

```
□ JSA completed
□ Personnel positioned safely
□ Pressure ratings verified
□ Relief valves set
□ Emergency procedures reviewed
□ Communication established
□ H2S monitor (if applicable)
```

### Emergency Procedures

**If Cement Sets Prematurely:**
1. Stop pumping immediately
2. Assess situation
3. Attempt to circulate
4. Drill out if necessary

**If Returns Lost:**
1. Continue pumping (if possible)
2. Reduce rate
3. Consider reverse circulation
4. Assess and plan remediation
